      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
    Hi, I’m Sarah Villanova Borges, and I was born in Minas Gerais, Brazil, a state without the famous Brazilian beaches and rainforests. Instead, we have hills, lots of them. Look to the horizon, and you’ll see rolling green hills covered in short vegetation. We also have incredible food and beautiful historical cities. If you ever visit Brazil, I highly recommend it!
      </p>

      <p>
    I come from a family of engineers. My mom and her dad before her both graduated in civil engineering. As soon as I learned what being an engineer meant, I wanted to follow in their footsteps. But destiny had other plans. Growing up in the early 2000s, I was surrounded by news about space shuttles and the discovery of exoplanets, and I soon fell in love with astronomy and space.
      </p>

      <p>
      Eventually, I found a compromise between my childhood dream of becoming an engineer and my fascination with the stars: I decided to study aeronautical engineering. I graduated in 2017 from ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica). But the stars didn’t want to let me go without a fight. I went on to complete a master’s in physics, also at ITA, studying magnetars. Now, I’m in the final year of my Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, where I work on numerical simulations of common envelope evolution.

      <p>
      There are many things I love about my work. First, I truly enjoy learning about astrophysics. Second, I’m passionate about science communication, sharing the same beauty of astrophysics that mesmerized a younger me with others. And third, I love the opportunities to travel and live in different places that research brings. In fact, all the background images on my website are from places I wouldn't have visited if it weren't for research. This background is the only exception, is from Diamantina, a historical touristic city in my home state back in Brazil.
      </p>

      <p>
      Outside of work, I have a lot of hobbies. You’ll often find me doing jigsaw puzzles, building Lego, or reading fantasy and murder mysteries. I believe that a pinch of challenge and adventure, whether it’s through my research or solving a really hard jigsaw puzzle, is what makes life interesting. I also love listening to music, traveling, sewing, cooking, and going to the cinema, concerts, and music festivals. If you are ever in Milwaukee in June or July, I highly recommend the best music festival of all, Summerfest. And at any time of the year, I recommend the Oriental Theatre, my absolute favorite cinema.

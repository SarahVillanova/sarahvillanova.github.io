      <h1>My Research</h1>

      <p>
        I have explored two areas of stellar astrophysics: emission models for soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars (SGR/AXPs) and numerical simulations of common envelope evolution (CEE). My work in both domains is united by a central goal: developing and improving theoretical models to better explain observations.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Envelope Simulations</h2>
      <p>
        CEE is a phase of binary evolution when a giant star engulfs its companion and is a progenitor of systems such as X-ray binaries and merging compact objects. The energy formalism for CEE assumes that the loss of orbital energy ($\Delta E_{\text{orb}}$) powers the ejection of the envelope, whose binding energy is $E_{\text{env}}$, with an efficiency $\alpha$: 
        $$E_{\text{env}} = \alpha \, \Delta E_{\text{orb}}.$$
        Most binary population synthesis codes adopt a single efficiency $\alpha$ for all systems, although this is unrealistic. The main difficulty in determining $\alpha$ lies in reducing a wide range of multiscale physics into a single parameter, combined with the scarcity of direct observations of CEE. My past, current, and future projects all center on this goal.
      </p>

      <h3>Envelope Homologous Expansion</h3>
      <p>
        In a <em>MNRAS</em> publication where I am the second author (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.5365V/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valsan et al., 2023</a>), we demonstrated through 3D hydrodynamic simulations using the moving-mesh code <strong>MANGA</strong> that CEE ejecta become homologous after sufficient time. Once this stage is reached, the subsequent evolution can be followed accurately with a 1D model, reducing computational cost by limiting 3D calculations to the onset of homologous ejection. My contribution to this work was the development of a 1D spherically symmetric hydrodynamics code used to evolve the ejected envelope after homologous expansion is reached.
      </p>

      <h3>A Correlation Between Post–Plunge-in Separation and Mass Ratio</h3>
      <p>
        Knowing $\alpha$ is essential for predicting the final separation of a system based on its initial parameters. A recent work has shown that the final separation from AGB simulations varies linearly with the mass ratio (Sand et al., 2020). Based on this, I ran 13 CEE simulations with RGB primaries (1–2 M$_\odot$) across four mass ratios and identified a linear correlation between the post–plunge-in separation and the mass ratio, normalized by the giant’s radius. I compared those results with all CEE simulations in the literature (RGB, AGB, and supergiant) and found that the correlation persists, even for partially bound envelopes. … A single-author publication is currently submitted (arXiv version available: <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251102150B/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arXiv:2511.02150</a>).

      </p>

      <h3>Comparing CEE Simulations with PNe</h3>
      <p>
        Post-CEE planetary nebulae (PNe) do not reflect the ejected envelope in its pristine form; winds from the central core also affect the morphology. I simulated how spherical winds from a pre-white-dwarf core interact with the CEE ejected envelope to form bipolar PNe. To do this, I mapped the ejected envelope from <strong>MANGA</strong> simulations into the AMR code <strong>RAMSES</strong>. As the envelope expands, I adapted RAMSES to gradually reduce refinement levels at the center, lowering computational cost. These adaptations allowed the simulations to reach timescales up to 100 years, far exceeding the ∼5 years achieved by Zou et al. (2020). I observed that initially bipolar morphologies gradually evolved into an elliptical form, consistent with the 2D wind simulations of García-Segura et al. (2018), but observed here for the first time in 3D. A first-author publication is currently in preparation.
      </p>
      <h2>Emission Models for SGRs/AXPs</h2>
      <p>
The standard magnetar model struggles to reproduce its full spectral energy distribution (SED) of 4U 0142+61 from near-infrared to hard X-rays. For this reason, I explored whether this object could instead be explained by an accreting white dwarf (WD).  In this model, X-rays arise from bremsstrahlung emission and hot surface spots, whereas the IR/optical radiation originates from the WD photosphere, the bremsstrahlung tail, and a surrounding passive disk modeled as a multi-temperature blackbody.       </p>

      <h1>My Research</h1>

      <p>
        My research focuses on the astrophysical processes that shape the lives and deaths of stars, especially through complex binary interactions and exotic compact objects. I use numerical simulations and theoretical modeling to study how these systems evolve, radiate, and ultimately influence the universe around them.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Envelope Simulations</h2>
      <p>
        The common envelope phase is one of the least understood but most crucial stages in binary star evolution. During this phase, one star expands and engulfs its companion, creating a shared gaseous envelope. This process can lead to the formation of close compact binaries, such as white dwarf–neutron star or black hole–neutron star systems, which are key sources of gravitational waves.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my Ph.D. work, I perform <strong>3D hydrodynamic simulations</strong> of common envelope evolution to understand how energy and angular momentum are transferred within the system. These simulations help constrain the physical conditions that determine whether the envelope is successfully ejected or whether the stars merge. My goal is to connect simulation outcomes with observations of post-common-envelope binaries and gravitational wave progenitors.
      </p>

      <h2>Emission Models for SGRs/AXPs</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to binary interactions, I’m interested in highly magnetized neutron stars known as <strong>Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs)</strong> and <strong>Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs)</strong>. These objects are thought to be <em>magnetars</em> — neutron stars powered by their extreme magnetic fields rather than by accretion or rotation.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work on emission models explores how the magnetic field geometry and surface processes of magnetars produce their characteristic X-ray and gamma-ray emission. By comparing theoretical predictions with observational data, we can gain insight into their magnetic evolution, crustal dynamics, and the mechanisms behind their bursts and flares.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below is an interview I participated in, where I discuss my paper and explain some of the ideas behind my emission modeling work:

      </div>

      <p>
        Both of these research directions — binary evolution and magnetar emission — share a common goal: to understand how compact objects form, evolve, and interact with their environments, shaping the observable universe in the process.
